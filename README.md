## Project Description:
ServiceSpot, an IT company, has enlisted our team to help them analyze their call center data. They receive daily calls from their customers and wish to gain insights into their operations. The data is currently scattered across multiple files, making it difficult to analyze effectively. Our mission is to develop an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) project using SSIS to consolidate and load data into a new enterprise data warehouse. As the data engineering team, our primary focus is to provide clean and structured data for the business. Subsequent report generation will be handled by a separate team of data analysts who will utilize the data warehouse.

## Project Goals:
- Retrieve data from multiple sources.
- Design a robust and efficient data warehouse.
- Implement necessary transformations using SSIS.
- Load transformed data into the data warehouse.

## Delivery:
- Complete solution including SSIS packages, SQL scripts, and documentation.
- SQL scripts to recreate every table in the data warehouse.
- A Word document detailing the project, including the schema of the data warehouse and key decisions made during its development.

## Project Workflow:
1. **Data Retrieval:** 
   - Extract data from various sources including flat files, databases, and APIs.
   
2. **Data Transformation:** 
   - Cleanse and transform raw data to meet the requirements of the data warehouse schema.
   
3. **Data Loading:** 
   - Load transformed data into the data warehouse using SSIS packages.
   
4. **Schema Design:** 
   - Design a well-structured data warehouse schema optimized for reporting and analysis.
   
5. **Documentation:** 
   - Provide comprehensive documentation explaining the project, including the schema design, ETL process, and key decisions made.

## Schema Overview:
- **Fact Tables:** 
  - Contains measurable data about call center activities (e.g., call duration, resolution time).
  
- **Dimension Tables:** 
  - Contains descriptive attributes for analyzing call center data (e.g., customer information, call types).
  
- **ETL Logs:** 
  - Tracks the execution of ETL processes, including any errors or warnings encountered.

## Project Timeline:
- **Phase 1 (Week 1-2):** 
  - Data gathering and analysis.
  - Schema design and ETL architecture planning.

- **Phase 2 (Week 3-4):** 
  - Implementation of SSIS packages for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
  - Validation and testing of ETL processes.

- **Phase 3 (Week 5):** 
  - Finalize documentation.
  - Prepare for project delivery.
